/*
Length of the longest subsequence s.t. the subsequence has consecutive elements. Such elements may appear in any order in the array.
Individual elements are one-length elements.
Duplicates are ignored.

output: 4 --> 1, 2, 3, 4

1. First insert all elements in a hash table.

2. Then, with 2n lookups, we find the result. 

3. For every element x in the hash, we will look for x-1 value in the hash. If x-1 is not available, it means x is the beginning of the sequence. In this case, we search for x+1, then for x+2 ..... till the search fails. 

4. If x-1 is available then it means x cannot be the beginning of the subsequence. Hence, it is ignored. And, next element in the hash is searched.

For the elements which are part of a subsequence but not the first elements, only one lookup is done. 
For the elements which are part of a subsequence and are the first element, 2 + (length-1) lookups are done. 
Here, length is the length of the subsequence beginning with the element.
